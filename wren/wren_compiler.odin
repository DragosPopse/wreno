// The maximum number of local (i.e. not module level) variables that can be
// declared in a single function, method, or chunk of top level code. This is
// the maximum number of variables in scope at one time, and spans block scopes.
//
// Note that this limitation is also explicit in the bytecode. Since
// `CODE_LOAD_LOCAL` and `CODE_STORE_LOCAL` use a single argument byte to
// identify the local, only 256 can be in scope at one time.

// The maximum number of upvalues (i.e. variables from enclosing functions)
// that a function can close over.
MAX_UPVALUES :: max(u8)

// The maximum number of distinct constants that a function can contain. This
// value is explicit in the bytecode since `CODE_CONSTANT` only takes a single
// two-byte argument.

// The maximum distance a  or CODE_JUMP_IF instruction can move the

// three levels:
//
//      "outside %(one + "%(two + "%(three)")")"
